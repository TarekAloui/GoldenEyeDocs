Overview
########
**Goldeneye** is a functional simulator of different number systems with fault injection capabilities. 
It is built on top of the Pytorch deep learning framework and the PytorchFi fault injection library. 
Goldeneye can be used either for conducting fault injection campaigns or the general study of the 
reliability and accuracy of various number systems. This documentation gives an overview of the different 
use-cases of Goldeneye and how to customize it to your own number systems and models.
